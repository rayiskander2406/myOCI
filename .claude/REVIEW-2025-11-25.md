# Release Progress Review - November 25, 2025

## Executive Summary
**Release Version**: v0.1.1 (Security Hardening) → v0.2.0 (SSH Security + DDoS + Vault)
**Review Period**: November 24-25, 2025
**Overall Status**: ⚠️ **PLANNING PIVOT REQUIRED**
**Recommended Action**: **Update TODO.md to match new PLANNING.md priorities**

### Key Metrics
- **v0.1.1 Tasks Completed**: 3/6 (50%)
- **v0.2.0 Tasks Completed**: 0/24 (0% - TODO.md is stale)
- **Planning Documents Updated**: 5 revisions today
- **Active Blockers**: 0 (but planning/execution mismatch exists)
- **Critical Discovery**: TODO.md is outdated (dependency management focus) vs PLANNING.md (security focus)

### Release Readiness Score: 6/10
**Status**: 🟡 YELLOW - Planning complete, execution documents need sync

---

## Critical Finding: Document Mismatch

### Current State Analysis

| Document | Content | Last Updated | Status |
|----------|---------|--------------|--------|
| **PLANNING.md** | v0.1.1 Security + v0.2.0 SSH/DDoS/Vault + v0.3.0 Passive Income | Nov 25 | ✅ Current |
| **TODO.md** | v0.2.0 Dependency Management (24 tasks) | Nov 24 | ❌ **STALE** |
| **COMPLETED.md** | v0.1.0 Release (14 tasks) | Nov 24 | ✅ Correct |

### The Problem

**TODO.md** contains detailed tasks for **dependency management** (DEPENDENCIES.md, UPDATE_POLICY.md, COMPATIBILITY_MATRIX.md, version pinning scripts).

**PLANNING.md** now prioritizes:
1. **v0.1.1**: SSH key permissions ✅, .gitignore ✅, Grafana password, Caddy BasicAuth, Loki localhost binding
2. **v0.2.0**: SSH Telegram notifications, TOTP 2FA, Redis+Age Vault, Cloudflare DDoS, Fail2ban
3. **v0.3.0**: Passive income services (Grass.io, Honeygain, PacketStream)

**Original v0.2.0 scope** (dependency management) has been **superseded** by security priorities.

### Impact

- Tasks being worked on today (security hardening) aren't tracked in TODO.md
- TODO.md tasks (dependency management) aren't what's being done
- Progress tracking is broken

## v0.2.0 Scope Evolution

### Original Scope (from TODO.md)
- Dependency management system
- DEPENDENCIES.md, UPDATE_POLICY.md, COMPATIBILITY_MATRIX.md
- Version checking scripts

## Velocity Analysis

### Recent Activity (Last 24 Hours)
```
Planning document revisions: 5
Git commits: 4
Security items completed: 3
New features planned: 8+ (SSH security, Vault, DDoS, Passive income)
```

### Estimation Accuracy
- **v0.1.1 Local Tasks**: Estimated 5 min → Actual 5 min ✅
- **Planning Effort**: Not estimated → Took ~2 hours
- **Server Tasks**: Not yet executed

### Velocity Observation
- Heavy planning day (document updates)
- Light execution day (only local tasks)
- Server-side work deferred

## Risk Assessment

### Active Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| **TODO.md is stale** | HIGH | Regenerate from PLANNING.md |
| **Server tasks pending** | MEDIUM | Execute v0.1.1 on server |
| **Grafana default credentials** | HIGH | Part of v0.1.1 (pending) |
| **No Netdata auth** | MEDIUM | Part of v0.1.1 (pending) |

### Resolved Today
- ✅ SSH key world-readable permissions
- ✅ No .gitignore for sensitive files
- ✅ Unused SSH key in repo directory

### New Risks Identified
| Risk | Severity | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| DDoS vulnerability | HIGH | Planned for v0.2.0 |
| No SSH login notifications | MEDIUM | Planned for v0.2.0 |
| No 2FA on SSH | MEDIUM | Planned for v0.2.0 |
| Secrets in plain text | MEDIUM | Vault planned for v0.2.0 |

## Quality Assessment

### Documentation Quality
- **PLANNING.md**: Comprehensive (1200+ lines), v5.0, excellent detail
- **TODO.md**: Comprehensive but **OUTDATED** (needs regeneration)
- **COMPLETED.md**: Current for v0.1.0

### Planning Quality
- Thorough security analysis completed
- Resource constraints considered (337MB RAM)
- Multiple options evaluated (Vault, DDoS, Auth)
- Phased approach defined (v0.1.1 → v0.2.0 → v0.3.0)

### Execution Quality
- Local tasks executed cleanly
- Server tasks deferred (appropriate prioritization)
- No rework required

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Next Session)

1. **Regenerate TODO.md** from PLANNING.md
   - Create v0.1.1 tasks (server-side security)
   - Create v0.2.0 tasks (SSH security + DDoS + Vault)
   - Archive or move original dependency management tasks
   - **Priority**: CRITICAL

2. **Complete v0.1.1 Server Tasks**
   - SSH to server and execute remaining 3 items
   - Create v0.1.1 tag
   - **Estimated**: 30 minutes

3. **Update COMPLETED.md**
   - Add today's completed items
   - Track v0.1.1 progress
   - **Estimated**: 15 minutes

### Decision Required

**Should original v0.2.0 scope (dependency management) be:**
- A. Merged into new v0.2.0 (with security)
- B. Deferred to v0.3.0 or v0.4.0
- C. Abandoned (security more important)

**Recommendation**: Option B - Defer to v0.3.0 after security and passive income

**Rationale**:
- Security hardening is more urgent than dependency management
- Passive income has clear ROI ($7-35/month)
- Dependency management is "nice to have" with current manual processes working

## Next Steps Checklist

### Immediate (This Session or Next)
- [ ] **Regenerate TODO.md** using `/generate-tasks` command
- [ ] Update COMPLETED.md with today's work
- [ ] SSH to server and complete v0.1.1
- [ ] Create and push v0.1.1 tag

### This Week
- [ ] Begin v0.2.0 implementation (SSH notifications first)
- [ ] Sign up for Cloudflare
- [ ] Generate Age key pair

### Decision Needed
- [ ] Confirm deferral of dependency management to v0.4.0
- [ ] Confirm v0.3.0 scope (passive income + Telegram SSH approval)

---

## Conclusion

### Summary
Today was a **strategic planning day** with significant scope evolution:
- v0.1.1 security hardening is 50% complete (local tasks done)
- v0.2.0 scope pivoted from dependency management to SSH security + DDoS + Vault
- v0.3.0 now includes passive income services
- **TODO.md needs regeneration** to match new priorities

### Recommended Action
1. **Run `/generate-tasks`** to create new TODO.md from PLANNING.md
2. Complete v0.1.1 server tasks (~25 min)
3. Begin v0.2.0 execution

### Overall Assessment
The project is in good shape strategically but needs housekeeping to align execution documents with planning documents. The security pivot is appropriate given the vulnerabilities identified in today's review.
